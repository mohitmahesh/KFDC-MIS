# START - Testing Protocol - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS SECTION
#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🎉 APPROVAL HIERARCHIES TESTING COMPLETE - 100% SUCCESS RATE! Comprehensive validation of BOTH APO and Estimates approval workflows completed successfully. **APO WORKFLOW (RO → DM → HO)**: ✅ All 9 tests passed - RO creates/submits to DM only, DM forwards to HO only, ADMIN sanctions, rejection/revision flow working, role-based blocks enforced correctly. **ESTIMATES WORKFLOW (ECW → PS)**: ✅ All 4 tests passed - ECW gets estimates, updates quantities, submits; PS approves; RBAC strictly enforced (ECW blocked from approval, PS blocked from quantity edits). **AUTHENTICATION**: ✅ All 5 user roles tested and working (RO, DM, ADMIN, ECW, PS). **FINAL RESULTS**: 23/23 tests passed (100% success rate). Both approval hierarchies are fully functional and ready for production. The system correctly enforces the new 3-tier APO approval process while maintaining the existing estimates workflow."

    message: "❌ **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE - UI TESTING BLOCKED**: Attempted comprehensive UI testing of all 8 test scenarios from review request but found **APPLICATION UNAVAILABLE**. The frontend URL (https://gzahkwfj-q1gwpv94-3000.stage-preview.emergentagent.com) shows 'Preview Unavailable!!!' with message 'Our Agent is resting after inactivity. Visit app.emergent.sh and restart the app to wake it up and restore your preview.' **IMPACT**: Cannot perform any UI testing until application service is restarted. **BACKEND STATUS**: All backend functionality has been thoroughly tested and confirmed working (100% success rate across all APIs and workflows). **REQUIRED ACTION**: Main agent needs to restart the Kubernetes preview service or contact support to restore application availability before UI testing can proceed. **NOTE**: This is not a code issue but an infrastructure/deployment issue."
